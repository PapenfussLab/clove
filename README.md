CLOVE: Classification of genomic fusions into structural variation events
===================

Clove is a program designed to post-process the output of sequencing data structural variation detection algorithms.
Clove scans the output of one or more sets of fusion calls for patterns of complex variations (such as balanced translocations) and summarizes fusion calls as such.
Clove also annotates the variants with read depth information from the alignment file.
